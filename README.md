This research work contributes in the field of Information logistics and ontology 
development in healthcare. So the main purpose of this thesis is to design an ontology 
based model that can fix information flow problems in the ward-round process of 
hospital unit. The ontology based model can be used to provide relevant information 
to the domain users according to their needs and demands. The ontology based model 
projects domain users profiling and describes their roles, information demands with 
competencies: skills, qualifications and experiences. The ontology based model will 
be implemented in OWL language that can be used in an application to support ward-round activities for achieving effective patient’s treatment process.
For ontology development is concerned, different ontology development 
methodologies have been reviewed from literature review by the author to analyze the 
existing problems in the ward-round. This thesis incorporates Hybrid Methodology 
(HM) that helps to develop ontology based model that addresses information flow 
problems in ward-round. The proposed ontology based model is developed in web 
Ontology Language (OWL) supported tool protégé 4.0.2 that can be considered as 
foundation to develop a software product with the help of IT practitioners and 
developers to fulfill medical practitioner’s demands in ward-round’s context.
